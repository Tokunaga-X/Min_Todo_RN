# Min Todo React Native (Expo)

Simple to-do list built with Expo/React Native. Add tasks, toggle complete, and delete from a clean, focused UI.

## Getting started

1. Install Node.js 18+ and npm.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start in Expo (Android emulator or Expo Go on device):
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Press "a" to open Android emulator, or scan the QR with Expo Go.
   ```

## Build for Android (APK/AAB)

- Ensure Android Studio + SDK/NDK are installed and ANDROID_HOME is set.
- Then run:
  ```bash
  npm run android
  ```
  This builds a native Android binary (debug by default). For store-ready builds, configure signing in `android` once generated by Expo or use `eas build -p android` (requires an Expo account).

## Project structure

- `App.js` – UI and to-do logic.
- `app.json` – Expo app configuration.
- `assets/` – placeholder icons/splash (replace with your own).

## Customizing

- Update colors/typography in `App.js` styles.
- Swap icons by changing `Ionicons` names in `App.js`.
- Replace placeholder images in `assets/` and update `app.json` if needed.
